# How to Pass Your AWS Certification Exam Without Fail

This is an incredible moment to be living if you are a life-long student like myself. We now have unparalleled access to low-cost information. I learned mainly from books when I initially started working in IT over 20 years ago. Free information on the Internet was considerably more limited, and if I wanted to set up a home lab, I had to spend thousands of dollars on equipment — and dedicate a spare room to it!

That has all changed, and those of us pursuing AWS credentials now have several fantastic alternatives. Several free as well as paid courses are accessible on the [Netcom Learning website]

The fact is that all of the materials are there, regardless of budget, but it is up to us as students to make appropriate use of them. Here are a few points based on my own experience of obtaining IT certifications for over 20 years:

Own your result – this can apply to almost anything in life and is one of the first things any coach will highlight. This means you must gather all of the material you require, devote the time and effort necessary to acquire it and ensure you are adequately prepared for the exam. If you make a mistake, own it, figure out what you did wrong, and fix it.
Be an active learner – we can all sit back and blindly ingest a load of knowledge by watching videos. However, active participation is required to guarantee that you retain the ability. This includes taking notes, completing practical exercises, taking practice examinations, and problem-solving. The more hands-on experience you have, the better. Another helpful activity is to answer other students' questions on forums, which involves some study. 

Identify your weak points – most practice exams will offer you feedback on the areas of expertise you lack. Make sure you use this information to go back and study those topics in greater depth.  

Make time for training regularly: Make time to train regularly. You will forget things if you study on a sporadic basis. The best approach is to set aside a particular study hour each day and adhere to it until the finish. Schedule this when your mind is clear and energized. This means getting up early in the morning for me.

Use practice exams as soon as possible – some people wait until the last week or two to begin using practice tests. Please make a point of identifying your weak points after each exam so you can improve on them.

Find some fascinating projects - if you're taking a course that includes actual lab activities, that's fantastic, but try to come up with your own as well. You will learn less if you stick to a script. You will know a lot more if you create your projects and have to handle issues. If you're new to AWS, start with a hands-on [labs-based AWS course] to learn the fundamentals, then start coming up with your projects or modifications.

These are just a few ways that might be beneficial. Everyone has a unique learning style, including a preference for video, reading, or hands-on activities. Design your training around your preferred learning style, but don't forget about the others, as they are all required to pass your [AWS certification tests].
